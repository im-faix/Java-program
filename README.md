The program is written in Java and uses the Swing library to create a Graphical User Interface (GUI). The GUI consists of a JFrame object, a JPasswordField object, and a JButton object.

The JFrame object is the main window of the GUI. It is created with a title "Password Protected Interface" and a size of 300x150 pixels. The JFrame object is set to do nothing when the user clicks the close button (JFrame.DO_NOTHING_ON_CLOSE) to allow for custom handling of the close event.

The JPasswordField object is a text field that allows the user to enter a password. It is created with a length of 20 characters.

The JButton object is labeled "Authenticate" and is used to initiate the password authentication process. It is created with an ActionListener that calls the authenticate() method when clicked.

The authenticate() method retrieves the entered password from the JPasswordField object and compares it to the correct password ("SRNMNCbca9108"). If the entered password matches the correct password, the program outputs a success message to the console. Otherwise, it shows an error dialog box indicating incorrect password entry.

The on_close() method is called when the user attempts to close the JFrame object. It prompts the user to enter the password again. Only when the entered password matches the correct one does the application dispose itself. In all other scenarios, an error dialog box appears informing the user of an incorrect password.

Finally, the main() method creates a new instance of the PasswordProtectedUI class and sets it to run on the Event Dispatch Thread using the SwingUtilities.invokeLater() method.

Overall, this program provides a basic implementation of a password-protected GUI, suitable for use within your broader project that features automatic shutdown capabilities.
